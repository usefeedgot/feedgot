# GDPR Compliance

**Last updated:** 31 October 2025

**feedgot** is committed to protecting Personal Data and complying with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This page summarizes our practices as controller and processor, our lawful bases, your rights, and key safeguards.

## Roles

- **Controller**: feedgot acts as controller for Personal Data related to your account, billing, support, and product analytics.
- **Processor**: feedgot acts as processor of Customer Data submitted to the Service by customers. Our Data Processing Addendum (DPA) governs such processing.

## Lawful Bases for Processing

- **Contract**: to provide and operate the Service you request.
- **Legitimate Interests**: to secure, maintain, and improve the Service; prevent abuse; and understand usage.
- **Consent**: for certain analytics/marketing or optional features where required.
- **Legal Obligation**: to comply with tax, accounting, and regulatory requirements.

## Data Subject Rights

Under GDPR, you have the right to:

- Access your Personal Data and obtain a copy.
- Rectify inaccurate or incomplete data.
- Erase data in certain circumstances.
- Restrict processing in certain circumstances.
- Data portability.
- Object to processing based on legitimate interests.
- Withdraw consent where processing relies on consent.

To exercise your rights, email [contact@feedgot.com](mailto:contact@feedgot.com). We will respond within one month or as required by law.

## Sub-processors

We engage carefully selected sub-processors to provide hosting, storage, analytics, email delivery, and related services. Examples may include infrastructure and hosting providers, email delivery platforms, analytics services, and managed databases. We maintain appropriate agreements and conduct due diligence. A current list is available on request via [contact@feedgot.com](mailto:contact@feedgot.com).

## International Transfers

Where Personal Data is transferred outside the EEA/UK, we implement appropriate safeguards such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), adequacy decisions, and supplementary measures.

## Security

We implement technical and organizational measures including encryption in transit, access controls, vulnerability management, and secure development practices. We monitor for threats and aim to minimize risks to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Data Retention

Personal Data is retained only as long as necessary to provide the Service and meet legal obligations. Upon account closure, we delete or anonymize data after a reasonable retention period unless law requires longer retention.

## Personal Data Breaches

In the event of a Personal Data breach, we will notify the competent supervisory authority within 72 hours when required by law, and we will notify affected users without undue delay where the breach is likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms.

## Data Processing Addendum (DPA)
